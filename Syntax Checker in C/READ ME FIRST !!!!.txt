             NOTE:                                        NOTE:  

-> This program will read another .cpp file and give the complete info about the code in that file e.g 
number of int, floats, char etc variable used if there is any error in the brackets how many function are used etc etc
	
-> To run this program properly make sure to have "test program1.cpp" file in your respective folder
You can also change the name of folder by modifying line num 83 of the program if you want or can ask for which file to open 
by changing the code a bit
